Hello there, I am **Nautilus4K**. I'm from Vietnam.
I have coding as a hobby for now and I like doing dumb stuff and see if it sticks, kinda a convenient mentality.
I am not used to using frameworks at all, and I guess I should, but maybe not now. Currently the languages I know are all primitives and really basic in their usage. I hope to change this in the future.

Almost all my projects are public. Either remnants of the past or a glimpse of my future, or at least that's what I would like to believe.
I don't know what to write here so thanks mom I guess?
