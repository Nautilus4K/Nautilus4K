## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking by my profile! I did some repos for my projects. Love 'em or hate 'em, I'm still new to the scene.
I am Quang Vinh, a Vietnamese ðŸ‡»ðŸ‡³. I have a passion for computer-y things. Even though I liked Arduino, it was shortlived.

Almost all of my projects (in the form of repos) are pretty much public right now (Except for some highly questionable and useless repos which I cannot find a use for).

Projects that I am proud of ðŸ“–:
- [My-Arduino-Projects](https://github.com/Nautilus4K/My-Arduino-Projects): For introducing me to programming as we know it.
- [Library-Software](https://github.com/Nautilus4K/Library-Software): For introducing me to backend, frontend, SQLite (even though unoptimized), OOP (even though unused in WSGI version), and integration of different libraries.
- [ATOMIC-Automatic-JUDGER](https://github.com/Nautilus4K/ATOMIC-Automatic-JUDGER): For introducing me to Docker, more advanced CSS stuffs, and gives me challenges to overcome.
